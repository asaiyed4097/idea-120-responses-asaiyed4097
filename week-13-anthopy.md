When reading through these chapters, I have come to the conclusion that the term game is very generic and could be used under a wide variety of concepts. Not all games have to be high budget 4d experiences with long detail stories and plot lines. A game is simply defined as an experience defined by rules.

The experiences we have within these rules defines how fun a game is. Being this broad there are many classifications to which games fall under, it being logical board games, task completion games, storytelling games, etc. There is a huge umbrella to what a game is.

As developers, they are in charged or what the players of these games experience. Those playing are entering your world and are subject to what you want them to witness. There are many ways the developers take you in, which is why video games are so appealing. It sometimes allows users to experience a different reality.
