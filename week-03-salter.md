# **Wagner**

When creating art that is a Gesamtkunstwerk every aspect of it needs to be explored and modern methods need to be implemented. Lighting, sound, body composition, and background environments are the key methods in engaging an audience and proper use of them will create the best experience for its viewers. Contemporary methods used by Wagner discussed in the reading was the way he used the first full scale of modern technologies of lighting, acoustics, and architectural manipulation to enhance the experiences of viewing a play.

For the best viewing experience the plays were held in a specially designed theater, hiding the orchestra below the stage allowing for the audience to hear them the best while also being able to see what was going on in the play. Wagner's theater also played with the spectators' visual perception of what was going on, it was constructed to also be the perfect acoustic receiver and diffuser. Wagners designs and tactics revolutionized modern arts.
