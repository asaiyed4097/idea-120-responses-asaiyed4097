I agree with James Bridle, the internet has become a weird place, especially now that children are targeted. There are millions of hours of unnecessarily long YouTube content of people unwrapping and playing with toys. Kids nowadays are contempt with watching other kids play with toys rather than themselves. Nursery rhyme videos are especially popular because the content creators know that kids watch them on repeat, it isn’t surprising that those are amongst the highest watched videos on YouTube. We have kids in the house who probably have 100s of hours of a single video played on repeat. The content creators are cashing in big on this. 

The way the algorithm is set up, Bridle argues that it is a form of abuse as many companies and creators are exploiting these vulnerabilities and are able to cash out big. I agree it’s a big shame that through these variabilities the children are being affected. The children should be able to use the internet without being exposed to violence through the proper filtration software. After reading this article I never realized how disturbing some of the content put out on “children’s internet” is. I agree we need to take further steps to make sure the internet is safter for young children to use, as they are much more vulnerable and influenceable.
