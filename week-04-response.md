The three messages provided in this image according to Barthes talks about are the linguistic message, the non linguistic also known as the coded message, and the non coded literal message. The image I provided is the iconic Uncle Sam propaganda poster. The linguistic message on this image is "I want YOU!" The words are telling its viewers that Uncle Sam wants them to join the Army for the war. The coded message in this poster is all the symbolism of american patriotism in the poster. The big star hat, Uncle Sam being used as the american mascot, him pointing towards us indicating he wants us, and the use of the flag colors insinuating patriotism. The third message is the non coded message- the literal image. In the image Uncle Sam is pointing at the viewer wearing patriotic clothing.
