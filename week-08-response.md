Targeted ads are a huge deal nowadays, they can be extremely annoying or extremely helpful. Now days companies are able to gather your data and are able to tailor ads specifically targeted for you. For example, I was doing some construction at home, I looked up a drill I was interested in and bought it. Knowing that I purchased it, now I am constantly receiving ads about different attachments for the drill, and other similar products. Targeted ads could have their bad and goods because it shows you specific items in the large sea of information in the internet, but this is also bad because they know what you are interested in, only sponsored and marketed ads from places paying a premium are getting to you. 

As Oâ€™Neal said, rather than getting to a broad audience targeted internet ads are becoming more personalized base on an algorithm. This is beneficial for companies, but we are giving up a sense of our privacy for their convenience.  The internet allows for data to be calculated and mapped in the matter of seconds rather than traditional ads which took a long time to gather data
