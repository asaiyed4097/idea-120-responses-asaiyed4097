The world of television, cinematography, and digital technology are combining giving us new perspectives and enabling us to do things we never thought were possible. Murray predicted in her book that we would be able to play with vantage points out of frame and make interaction with backgrounds much more easily. This is exactly what happened during the production of The Mandalorian, new technology with LED screens and the use of video game software allowed us to change vantage points and backgrounds.  Murrays predictions were spot on, when alluding to the use of digital tech to change perspectives easily swap and pan around backgrounds in film. WIth this LED screen the actors are now able to interact in live time with their background because they can see it, rather than just a plain green screen waiting for post production to edit the background. The DP can also fram up to certain key background features rather than guess where they would be, like when using green screens. The use of unreal engine software also allows the background to move with the camera's field of view, with the virtual set. Lighting is also improved with the virtual LED sets, providing realistic lightings and reflections on the actors and props, something which lacked green screens. This new tech is game changing.
