In Weapons of Math Destruction Cathy O'neil describes how unfair and flawed the rating systems are when it comes to assistance and grading poorer individuals. Cathy describes the algorithm and programs used in these situations to be discriminatory, because  they just take into account a few factors and not the entire situation. This leads to the rapid decline and destruction of certain individuals being rated unfairly, which is what she refers to as “weapons of math destruction”. The data used is strictly numbers based and doesn't take into account other major factors when placing people in a rating system. This program tends to rate people unfairly, while poorer individuals are being rated by software the rich tend to be rated on a personal level. The data being mined and rated is dark and not always accurate, but is  being used widespread.

 Cathy O'neil goes on to describe the great lengths which universities go to be ranked higher on the list. This process is ugly, they go great lengths to inflate their rates to look better than they actually are, all in the name of profits. The higher the ranking is the higher the presigise, the more honor they receive and the higher they could justify the cost of their institution. Institutions had being using tricks like these to seem better than they are.  Cathy O'neil goes on to show that these places are flawed because of the janky rating system, and that what is more important than a “rating system” one should consider which is the “best fit”  based on their “own rating system”,because what's best for one person may not be the best option for the next.

The reinforcement of racism is rampant in data analysis, the police monitoring systems set up software reinforces this because it steers cops to certain area where small petty “neusance” crimes are committed, and naturally these small crimes are more rampant, so to keeps them in certain areas because of feedback loop. The policing itself spawns new data, which justifies more policing. The data itself may be color blind, but most american cities are segregated and geography is a likely proxy for race.
