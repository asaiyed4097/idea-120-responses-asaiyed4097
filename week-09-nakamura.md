Interactive Media- Lisa Nakamura

After reading Digitizing race, Nakamur’s citation of Lev Manovich saying, "interactive media ask us to identify with someone else’s mental structure”, what I drew from this quote was that we are at the liability of the creators ideas. The power the media has over the minds of the consumers is extremely sensitive, and this data needs to be analyzed. The content creator has ultimate power weather it was on purpose or not, to influence it consumers. As content consumers we are at the liability of the creators because they are able to filter which ever, they want, to bring you into their world. This is dangerous because this can cause certain people to become groomed into thinking and behaving upon whatever ideology the content creator puts out. 

An example of a tool I use daily in which I believe carry designers reflections and mental structure of their own identity is Instagram and Facebook. Initially Instagram was used to as a platform to communicate and share pictures and messages with friends and family. But now it has become a place to “flex” and became a place to showoff, for some. A lot of users fall into this trap and feel the need in showing off a perfect insta lifestyle. The original content creators never thought it would result to this, but this is what it evolved to. Kids nowadays are surrounded by those “insta celebs” and then feel the need to also post similar pics as them.
